# CS7641 GaTech Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1 Supervised Learning

You should implement five learning algorithms. They are:

- Decision trees with some form of pruning
- Neural networks
- Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- k-nearest neighbors


## Project 2 Randomized Optimization

You must implement four local random search algorithms. They are:

- randomized hill climbing
- simulated annealing
- a genetic algorithm
- MIMIC

## Project 3 Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

You are to implement six algorithms.

The first two are clustering algorithms. You can choose your own measures of distance/similarity. Justify your choices.

- Expectation Maximization
- Clustering Algorithm of Your Choice

The last four are dimensionality reduction algorithms:

Linear:

- PCA
- ICA
- Randomized Projections

Non-linear: 

- Manifold Learning Algorithm of Your Choice

## Project 4 Markov Decision Processes

Solve two interesting MDP problems with reinforcement learning approaches.
